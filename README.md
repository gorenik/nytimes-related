These are the source RDF files used to generate the (Who's on First (at the New
York Times))[http://aaronland.info/nytimes/related/] webpages between 2006 and
2010.

These are _not_ the actual articles as published by the New York Times but
instead the metadata about each article (authors, subjects, locations, etc.)
along with pointers to the articles themselves.

_Comprehensive documentation still needs to be written._

OMGWTFRDF??????!?!?

Yes. It's all in scary RDF/XML. It's not how I would do it now but it's what I
did then. It looks scarier than it is. Please submit patches, fixes,
whatever. That's part of the reason I am putting this all on Github.
