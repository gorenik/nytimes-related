These are the source RDF files used to generate the [Who's on First (at the New
York Times)](http://aaronland.info/nytimes/related/) webpages between 2006 and
2010.

These are _not_ the actual articles as published by the New York Times but
instead the metadata about each article (authors, subjects, locations, etc.)
along with pointers to the articles themselves.

_Comprehensive documentation still needs to be written._

OMGWTFRDFXML ??????!?!?

Yes. It's all in scary RDF/XML. It's not how I would do it now but it's what I
did then. It looks scarier than it is. Please submit patches, fixes,
whatever. That's part of the reason I am putting this all on Github.

OMGWTFUTF8 ???!!??!?!

I have no excuses. Some of the data is probably garbled beyond recognition at
this point. I suppose it would be possible to recrawl the New York Times website
to fix those mistakes but I haven't done that, ever.

I'm sorry. Luminoso's [Fixing common Unicode mistakes with Python â€” after they’ve been made](http://blog.lumino.so/2012/08/20/fix-unicode-mistakes-with-python/) might fix some of the problems (maybe?) but I have not tried this yet...
